•	STOP AND THINK Never assume anything is safe online. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is! Never provide 
     sensitive information on social media or via email. Be cautious of promises of money or rewards in ads and email. 
     Do not open attachments unless      you are sure of the sender and purpose.  
•	GET ANTIVIRUS AND KEEP IT UPDATED
•	BACK-UP YOUR DATA Computers crash and phones and devices break and get lost.Simply use an external portable 
      storage device or cloud services to back-up everything that is important to you. If you do stumble across
      something and make a mistake infecting your
      computer, you’ll still have your important family photos and documents backed up externally.
